<p>I am from SJB, st.Johns brigade.My CCA teaches First Aid, Foot Drills and PT(physical training).
You may feel that SJB is just another UG cca with no meaning, bht you are wrong.
SJB trains alot on discipline,consideration and physical fitness.
I learn First Aid, which is a important to everyone.No matter what people think of my CCA,
i will always appreciate both the soft and hard skills taught to me. I love my CCA!!! </P>
